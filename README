XML::Filter::DetectWS version 0.01
==================================

DESCRIPTION

This a PerlSAX filter that detects which character data contains ignorable whitespace and optionally filters it. 

Note that this is just a first stab at the implementation and it may change completely in the near future. Please provide
feedback whether you like it or not, so I know whether I should change it. 

The XML spec defines ignorable whitespace as the character data found in elements that were defined in an
<!ELEMENT> declaration with a model of 'EMPTY' or 'Children' (Children is the rule that does not contain '#PCDATA'.)

In addition, XML::Filter::DetectWS allows the user to define other whitespace to be ignorable. The ignorable whitespace
is passed to the PerlSAX Handler with the ignorable_whitespace handler, provided that the Handler implements this
method. (Otherwise it is passed to the characters handler.) If the SkipIgnorableWS is set, the ignorable whitespace is
simply discarded. 

XML::Filter::DetectWS also takes xml:space attributes into account. See below for details. 

CDATA sections are passed in the standard PerlSAX way (i.e. with surrounding start_cdata and end_cdata events),
unless the Handler does not implement these methods. In that case, the CDATA section is simply passed to the
characters method.
